### Predictive Analytics Capstone Project - Classification Models in Python
This Jupyter Notebook is the notebook for my capstone project on heart disease prediction.

#### Source of dataset

#### Project Goal 
Predict will a critically ill patient who undergoes RHC die during the procedure.

#### Introduction
A right heart catheterization (RHC) is a procedure to check conditions of patient's heart and lungs. 58 features were created for this predictive models. Seven classification models (K nearest neighbors, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) were built, trained, and evaluated. Best model that gives the highest AUC score was chosen and outcomes were communicated.

#### Prerequisites
