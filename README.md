### Predictive Analytics Capstone Project - Classification Models
This Jupyter Notebook is the notebook for my capstone project on heart disease prediction.

### Project Goal 
Predict will a critically ill patient who undergoes RHC die during the procedure.

### Introduction
A right heart catheterization (RHC) is a procedure to check conditions of patient's heart and lungs. A critically ill patients who undergoes RHC may have procedure related risks or complications. In this project, I created 58 features for predictive models. I built, trained, and evaluated seven classification models (K nearest neighbors, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting. I chose the best model that gives the highest AUC score and communicated outcomes.

### Prerequisites 
Python (using version 3.6.8)
Optional: Jupyter Notebook
